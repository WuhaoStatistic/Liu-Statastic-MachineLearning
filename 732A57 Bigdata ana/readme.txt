从我一个考试贼厉害门门A的同学那得来的总结

There are three large topics:
1) Jose's algorithms. The algorithms themselves are very easy, and the pseudo-code will be given,
 so there is no need to worry about this as long as you know pySpark. Just refresh the code from the labs.
 Plus you shoul look up the main advantage of Spark over MapReduce in iterative ML algorithms.

2) Olaf's noSQL databases. Unfortunately, I think, we should learn by heart his two lectures. Gladly, they are nicely structured.

3) Parallel Computing part. The most awefully structured and large at the first glance. 
Here, I just answered all previos exam questions and that's it because, otherwise,
 too much to remember. Gladly, the exam questions are pretty repetitive.

部分中文要点在old exam里面，每年考试不同 看着来。
