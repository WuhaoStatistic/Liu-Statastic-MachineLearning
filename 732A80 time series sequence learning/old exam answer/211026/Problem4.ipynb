    "**a)** You are presented with the task of doing predictions on a long time-series. You think a **temporal convolution network** (TCN) could be a good idea. For the model you decide on using filter size of 3, 2 hidden layers and dilations of $1, 3,$ and $5$ for the first hidden layer, the second hidden layer and the output layer respectively. What is the perceptive field of this model?\n",

    "**b)** After runing the model you realise that you have long-time dependences in the data that you are unable to capture with a TCN, so you decide to work with a **recurrent neural network** (RNN) instead. You are now tasked with the problem of fitting this model using your singular time-series. Describe 2 different approaches to train an RNN when dealing with a single time-series, discuss the pros and cons of these approaches.\n",
