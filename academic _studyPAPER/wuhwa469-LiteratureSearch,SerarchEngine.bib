Abstract = {Recovery of information from the web is a complicated task, for which a search engine uses a web crawler. The search engine provides an interface for accessing and retrieving massive web storage information. The software retrieves traverses and indexes the web pages methodically. Web crawler’s primary role is to find and retrieve related web pages with multiple algorithms. In this paper, an experimental performance analysis of web crawlers using single and multi-threaded web crawling and indexing algorithm for the application of smart web contents is presented. The simulation work addresses the key parameters for this single, multithreaded and hierarchical clustering strategy, including harvest ratio and execution time. For the corresponding crawling URL web pages, performance metrics of harvest ratio, execution time, precision, recall, harmonic mean and fallacy have been estimated.},

Abstract = {To promote website in search engine rankings in order to get better visibility and more traffic, search engine optimizers have to follow legal ways but some search engine optimizers manipulate the web pages and boost the irrelevant pages in search results and this leads to practice the problem of web spam. These malicious pages reduce the performance of the search engine. We innovates a method to override the irrelevant search results. In this paper a new approach is designed and developed to move non-deserving pages downward from list of results returned by search engine. The first step was to determine the importance of different page features used for the ranking of a page in search results. Based on this information the devised system identified the features in a page and assigned some weight to each feature. The user query i.e. search keyword, precision and ranking factor are used to calculate precision score of a page. This score is used to predict ranking position for each page},

Abstract = {Conference paper presentation at the Medical Library Association 2020 vConference (August 10-14)BACKGROUND: When conducting a systematic review, the search for evidence can be a challenging process for novice searchers. There are complicated procedures with multiple sources of guidelines, and the prevailing instruction targets intermediate and higher skill levels. To address these challenges, this project created self-instruction materials framed along an explicit search workflow. This instruction was developed through a qualitative content analysis of four major systematic review guidelines. The result is a comprehensive yet straightforward self-instruction guide for advanced literature search skills. This paper reports the development methodology and observations from the guide’s use in reference consultations. DESCRIPTION: Instructional development began with the qualitative content analysis of search guidelines by four organizations (Cochrane, NAM, AHRQ, and CRD). Over 300 recomme},
